# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game_Project
This project is a simple 2-player Tic Tac Toe game built using C language. It runs in the console, allowing players to take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. The program checks for win conditions or draws after each move, making it an interactive way to practice logic, arrays, and control structures in C.
