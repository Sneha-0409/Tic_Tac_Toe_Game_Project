# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game_Project
This project is a simple 2-player Tic Tac Toe game built using C language. It runs in the console, allowing players to take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. The program checks for win conditions or draws after each move, making it an interactive way to practice logic, arrays, and control structures in C.

Overview of the project:
I created this project using basic concepts of the C programming language such as arrays, loops, conditionals, and functions. I designed a 3x3 grid using a character array and implemented a turn-based system where each player inputs their move. The program checks the grid after each move to detect win conditions or a draw. I used functions to modularize the code — for displaying the board, taking input, checking the game status, and switching turns — which helped keep the code organized and reusable. The project was entirely developed and tested in a console environment.
